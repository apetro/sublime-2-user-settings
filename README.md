This is Andrew's `Sublime Text 2` user settings.

Specifically, on MacOS X is `/Users/{username}/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User`.

# Why should I care?

You probably shouldn't.

But if you find some settings here that you want to use, hey, that's cool.

# What are you using, how and why?

## Packages

### Gist

### MarkdownEditing

### Package Control

Package Control for Sublime package management, of course.  I keep all the Package Control configuration and metadata out of source control, however, so that Package Control can operate independently in each of my Sublime installations.

## Key bindings and such

### Split pane editing

I've got custom key bindings inspired by but not the same as those demonstrated [by Jeffrey Way](https://tutsplus.com/lesson/configuring-and-mastering-split-windows/).  I only tend to use up to two panes, so I've optimized for that.

### Vintage

I use Vintage mode.  Similar keys in Sublime and `vim` makes coping with `vim` easier.


# Why put this in a public GitHub repo?

A few reasons.  I want it versioned and backed up off my computer.  I want to share it across a few computers I use and I want to be able to fairly instantly zap it onto any new machine I touch.  I like GitHub and I see no reason any of this needs to be secret.
