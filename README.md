This is Andrew's `Sublime Text 2` user settings.

Specifically, on MacOS X is `/Users/{username}/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User`.

# Why should I care?

You probably shouldn't.

But if you find some settings here that you want to use, hey, that's cool.


# Why put this in a public GitHub repo?

A few reasons.  I want it versioned and backed up off my computer.  I want to share it across a few computers I use and I want to be able to fairly instantly zap it onto any new machine I touch.  I like GitHub and I see no reason any of this needs to be secret.
